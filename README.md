$params = @{
    'Paths' = 'C:/path/to/folder1', 'C:/path/to/folder2', 'C:/path/to/folder3', 'C:/path/to/folder4', 'D:/path/to/folder1', 'D:/path/to/folder2', 'D:/path/to/folder3', 'D:/path/to/folder4'
    'DestinationScreenWidth' = 1920
    'DestinationScreenHeight' = 1080
    'DestinationMonitor' = 'M'
    'Rows' = 4
    'Cols' = 2
    'OffsetLeft' = 0

## FAQ

Q: System requirements?

- Windows 7 and up
- Powershell v2

Q: I want to open multiple sets of windows quickly. How do I do that?

Simply make a copy of the usage script above for each set of `Explorer` windows you want to open. Configure each script with a set of `Paths`. Keep the scripts on your Desktop. You can now easily run those scripts, by right-clicking and selecting `Run with Powershell`.

Alternatively, as seen in this demo, you can pin `Powershell` onto your Taskbar, then pin your scripts by dragging and dropping over the Powershell on the Taskbar. Now you can easily run them by right-clicking on Powershell, and clicking the script.

Q: Help! the Taskbar is overlapping some of my Explorer windows!

You are probably an advanced user, and are not using `-ModeEasy`. A Taskbar with a single row of icons is often 40 pixels high (if at top or bottom) or 62 pixels wide (if at left or right). So:

- If your Taskbar is on the **bottom**, reduce the `-DestinationScreenHeight` by 40. <br />
- If your Taskbar is on the **top**, reduce the `-DestinationScreenHeight` by 40, and increase `-OffsetTop` by 40. <br />
- If your Taskbar is on the **left**, reduce the `-DestinationScreenWidth` by 62, and increase `-OffsetLeft` by 62.  <br />
- If your Taskbar is on the **right**, reduce the `-DestinationScreenWidth` by 62, and reduce `-OffsetLeft` by 62.


p.s. If your Taskbar is has *two or more rows* of icons, then change the above by multiples of 40 or 62.

Q: Why are there gaps between windows?

It's likely you have Windows Aero active, since it is turned on by default on Windows 7 and above. When Aero is active, a window's dimensions includes window borders and shadow effects. Aero theme makes shadow regions around a window transparent, hence creating "gaps".

## Background

An `Explorer` window cannot be opened at a specified coordinate on the screen through its command line. Because the author could not find any working solution that could conveniently open multiple Explorer windows in specified folders arranged in a predictable and orderly fashion on the screen, there had to be a tool that could do this.
